Our research investigates the genetic underpinnings of complex human diseases, particularly on Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). In addition to identifying disease-associated genetic risk factors, we study intermediate phenotypes (endophenotypes) such as plasma biomarkers, neuroimaging features, and longitudinal cognitive decline.

Our genomic analyses incorporate array-based genotyping, whole genome sequencing, and transcriptomic profiling, including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies using RNA sequencing data.
