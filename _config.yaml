description: Our lab is dedicated to investigating the genetic factors that contribute to the risk and complex inheritance patterns of human diseases, such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease. In addition to whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, we employ a range of transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility.
