# The Kamboh Lab 

  Our lab is dedicated to investigating the genetic factors that contribute to the risk and complex inheritance patterns of human diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease.

  In addition to whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, we employ a range of transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility.
