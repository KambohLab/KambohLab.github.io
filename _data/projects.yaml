  description: The goal of the PITT-ADRC Neurogenetics Core is to continue collecting and archiving DNA and blood samples from new and existing AD patients and controls in order to enlarge our case-control and family sample and to augment the amount of existing DNA that would be critical to future efforts in identifying new genes/variants for AD.
